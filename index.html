    MoneroSMS requires Python 3.10+ with the requests library installed.

    Back up the file it generates in order to retain access to your account. Lost accounts cannot be recovered.

    $ monero-sms.py pricing    

    Get your Monero payment address:
    $ monero-sms.py xmraddress
    
    After paying the address enough USD equivalent, check balance with:
    $ monero-sms.py credits

    Buy a virtual number (email support@voidnet.tech to buy a real cell number):
    $ monero-sms.py listnumbers
    $ monero-sms.py buynumber [number]

    Watch a thread:
    $ monero-sms.py watch [number]

    $ monero-sms.py disableemail

    <h1>Q&A</h1>

    Can I have multiple numbers?
        Each account can only have 1 number, but you may have multiple accounts unless you have
	been banned from the service.

    Does it support groups?
        No, maybe at a later time.

    Does it support MMS?
        Yes, via email relay. Limited attachment types.

    Can I use Tor or a VPN?
        Yes, use of Tor or VPNs are allowed and are recommended.
	To use .onion for the application, specify MONERO_SMS_TOR=tor_socks_port

    Do you port numbers in or out?
        Numbers can be ported in for $1.49 or ported out for free. Done on a best-effort basis

    Can I use the numbers for SMS 2fa?
        Yes, but virtual numbers may not work for some services. Use a hardware device or TOTP when possible.

    Can I make or receive VoIP calls?
        Not yet.

    Do you recycle numbers?
        We do not recycle phone numbers that are used at least once. When we release numbers, upstream providers may.
	The only exception is if a number was refunded (in which case it never sent/received from our server).

    Do you offer support?
        Yes, email support@voidnet.tech with your account ID or message on Signal at 636-275-0837

    Can I use the service as an API?
        Yes, as long as the use conforms with the terms of service.

    Why would I want a real cell number instead of a virtual numbers?
        Virtual numbers (numbers associated with VoIP providers) are frequently blacklisted by various
        companies and as such cannot always receive or send some messages, this frequently breaks account
        activation.

    What countries are available?
        We only sell US numbers for now.

    Can I text non-US/Canadian numbers?
    	Not yet. (Other "1" country code numbers may work). This applies to both send/receive.

    Can I have a refund?
        Generally no. If you haven't bought a number yet we may be able to refund

    Do you accept USD/Fiat/Bitcoin/altcoins?
	Bitcoin, fiat, and shitcoins accepted manually. In the future they will
        be accepted in an automated fashion. Monero is the most private method.
